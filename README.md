Reference:Kaggle.com

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Python 3 installed on your machine.
# Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
# pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# How to Run the Code

1)Download the dataset:
Download the IMDb dataset from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores and place it in the data directory.

2)Run the Jupyter Notebook:
# jupyter notebook imdb_score_prediction.ipynb
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser and run each cell sequentially to see the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

3)Alternatively, you can run the Python script directly:
# python imdb_score_prediction.py
This will execute the code in imdb_score_prediction.py and display the predicted IMDb scores for a sample of movies.
